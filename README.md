# Open Legal Access Project

## Introduction

The Open Legal Access project aims to provide a set of open source website templates for use by organisations promoting access to justice. The project is maintained by me, Mike Bean, with support from my company Isaac Parker Creative Services Limited, a digital marketing agency focused on commercial law firms.

The project will deliver website templates consisting of HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, and front-end presentational Javascript in three categories:

### 1. Marketing & Promotion

Templates for website pages that help organisations to promote community legal services and access to justice projects.

### 2. Service Delivery

Templates for website pages that help organisations to deliver online services to their clients.

### 3. Fundraising

Templates for website pages that help organisations to collect donations to fund their services.
